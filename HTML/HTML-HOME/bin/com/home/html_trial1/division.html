<p>WHAT THIS BOOK COVERS
The contents of each chapter can be summarized as follows. Chapter 1 provides an introduction
to the book. Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the structure
and components about relational databases. Some key technologies in developing and
designing databases are also given and discussed. The procedure and components used
to develop a practical relational database with three database versions, such as Microsoft
Access, SQL Server 2008, and Oracle Database 10g XE, are analyzed in detail with some
real data tables in our sample database CSE_DEPT.
Chapter 3 provides an introduction to JDBC APIs and JDBC drivers. A detailed
introduction to components and architecture of JDBC is given with step - by - step illustrations.
Four popular types of JDBC drivers are discussed and analyzed with their advantages
and disadvantages in actual database applications. The working structure and
operational principle of using JDBC drivers to establish a valid database connection,
build a SQL statement, and process the query results are discussed and presented in
detail. JDBC RowSet, a useful tool, is also discussed and analyzed with some example
codes.</p>

<p  >Starting with Chapter 6 , the real database programming techniques with Java, query
data from database, are provided and discussed. Two parts are covered in this chapter:
Part I contains detailed descriptions of how to develop professional data - driven applications
with the help of the JAPI and plug - in tools with some real projects, and this part
contains a lot of hiding codes that are created by NetBeans IDE automatically when using
those tools and wizards. Therefore, the coding for this part is very simple and easy. Part
II covers an advanced technique, the runtime object method, in developing and building
professional data - driven applications. Detailed discussions and descriptions of how to
build professional and practical database applications using this runtime method are
provided combined with two real projects. In addition to basic query techniques, advanced
query methods, such as PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, and stored procedure, are
also discussed and implemented in this chapter with some real sample projects.</p>

<p>Chapter 9 discusses the development and implementation of Java Web services in the
NetBeans IDE environment. A detailed analysis of the structure and components of Java
Web services is provided. Two popular databases, SQL Server and Oracle, are discussed
and used for two example Web service projects, which include WebServiceSQLApp and
WebServiceOracleApp. Each Web service contains different operations that can be used
to access different databases and perform the desired data actions, such as Select, Insert,
Update, and Delete, via the Internet. To consume those Web services, different Web
service client projects are also developed in this chapter. Both Windows - based and Web -
based Web service client projects are discussed and built for each kind of Web service.
Eight projects in total, including the Web service projects and the associated Web service
client projects, are developed. All projects have been debugged and tested and can be
run in any Windows compatible operating system, such as Windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, and
Windows 7.</p>
