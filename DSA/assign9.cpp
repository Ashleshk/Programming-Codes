 * Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the
 * creation of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not
 * use priorities, then the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system.
 * Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write functions to add job and delete
 * job from queue.
